## Work

### Start

Create database with name "AC" from console or phpmyadmin eg.
Then run console command into project folder:  
`php ./bin/start.php migrate`  
for created db tables. It safely for data in existing tables.  
SQL query for tables created is in file "create_sql.php".

Then run:  
`php ./bin/start.php useradd <username> <password>`  
for user with admin grants creating.  
Password minimal length = 7, it can be change in config.

**_After user with specific permissions adding you must first permissions added_**  
Other users can be added from the admin panel.  
Before user creating you can create permissions (resource, action) then roles.
Permissions can be added automatically from classes names of models directory and their methods (you can change it from presenters and theirs methods) or manually.  
If you set in permissions only resource without action - you allow all actions of the resource.

**_If you change columns of table "users" in file "create_sql.php" change it in "app/Model/UsersTableColumns.php" too_**

**_Users factory can be run from "bin/factorys/user"_**

### Config

Configs files are located in "app/config". Read this [documentation](https://doc.nette.org/en/configuring).  
Config `pages_sqlite` is require for page menu on main page and admin pages.

### Routing

"app/Core/RouterFactory.php", [documentation](https://doc.nette.org/en/application/routing)  
Application use three main routes: "Home", "Sign" and "Admin".  
Other routes as in Nette Framework: "Home::Pages::OtherPresenters::method", "Admin::Pages::OtherPresenters::method".

### Models

`PermissionFacade` - add, edit, delete permissions  
`UserFacade` - add, edit, delete users

#### DB

### Accessory

Traits and classes for using in presenters.  
`RequireLoggedUser` - trait for page that need autentication (in user not logged - redirect to sign in)

### Authentication

Use Nette\Security\User with my simple App\Core\Authenticator with Nette Coockie Storage, but  
in App\Bootstrap.php logic for set storage and table into db was added

### Authorization

ACL  
roles, permissions (resource, action)
user -> array roles  
role -> array permissions  
permission is resource and action  
App\Core\MyAuthorizator check permissions.

#### Client banned

### Admin page and menu creating

#### Nav menu

For admins basic pages: "Users", "Roles", "Permissions", "Logs", "Cache".  
It is created manually.

#### Sidebar menu

Menu section CMS is created automatically from filesystem.  
The file structure is as follows eg:

```
CMS dir
	First dir
	FirstPresenter.php (namespace "App\UI\Cms\First" and class "FirstPresenter")
			Second dir
			SecondPresenter.php (namespace "App\UI\Cms\Second" and class "SecondPresenter")
					Third dir
					ThirdPresenter.php (namespace "App\UI\Cms\Third" and class "ThirdPresenter")
```

Menu point will be viewed only if Presenters class existed.
That is, only controllers classes are used and if you not need the menu point - create method into presenter. And if you need menu links - create dirs and into it create presenters class for action.  
Permissions for user is ["Cms", "menu"].
